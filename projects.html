                <h4>Photoshop</h4><br>
                <p style="line-height: 1.2rem; font-size: 14px;">In my Photoshop project, I crafted an interior design scene from scratch, focusing on creating a cohesive and visually appealing space. Using various tools like the free transform tool and selection techniques, I integrated key elements such as walls, floor, furniture, and accessories.
            I paid special attention to details like lighting effects, as well as creating an overall ambient lighting scheme to enhance the atmosphere of the room.</p><br>
